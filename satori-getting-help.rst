Getting help on Satori 
======================

Email help
^^^^^^^^^^

If you need help with anything , please email satori-support@techsquare.com . Tech support
is mostly normal business hours, so responses are usually quicker during regular work hours. 
Response times during the night and over weekend and holidays (or when ten is a lot going on!)
can be slower.  

Tech technical support team are familiar with some aspects of applications software and are
always willing to help. For some things though, like trouble shooting advanced AI workflows, it
can be good to reach out to other people using the system as they may have useful advice/tricks. 
The Satori slack channel is available for connecting everyone on Satori in a more free form way.
