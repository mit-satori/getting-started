Satori is a GPU heavy high-performance Power 9 system developed as a collaboration between MIT and IBM.
It has 64 1TB memory Power 9 nodes. Each node hosts four NVidia V100 32GB memory GPU cards. Within a 
node GPUs are linked by an NVLink2 network thst supports nearly to 200GB/s bi-directional transfer
between GPUs. A 100Gb/s Infiniband network with microsecond user space latency connects the cluster 
nodes togehter. 

How can I get an account?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anyone with active MIT credentials (i.e. all students, employees and sponsored 
guest account https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts ) can connect to the Satori portal and create a project. A
basic project is provided somewhat limited access. Once a project has been created the project lead may
request extra access as needed.
